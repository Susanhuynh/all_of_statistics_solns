errata:
all of statistics chapter 15 exercises 6 and 7 are ill posed. Covariance matrices are not positive definite.


Explanation:
By the defn of multivariance normal, covariance matrix must be positive definite.
Thm 0*:A Hermitian (or symmetric) matrix is positive definite iff all its eigenvalues are positive

problem 6: Cov(X) = [2,6; 6,2] -> eigenval = {-4,8}
problem 7: Cov(X) = [1,3; 3,1] -> eigenval = {-2,4}

Thus, by Thm 0, niether Cov matrix is positive definite. Thus definition of multivariate normals is ill posed.

To Fix:
problem 6: Cov(X) <= [6,2; 2,6] -> eigenval = {4,8}
problem 7: Cov(X) <= [3,1; 1,3] -> eigenval = {2,4}
